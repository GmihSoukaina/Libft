## 🎯 About The Project

Libft is my first project at 1337 school, where I recreated various standard C library functions from scratch. This journey wasn't just about coding - it was about understanding the fundamental building blocks that make up the C programming language.

### 🌟 What I Learned

- Deep understanding of memory management in C
- String manipulation and data structures
- Proper function documentation and coding standards
- The importance of optimization and efficiency
- Unit testing and debugging skills

## 💡 Personal Experience

Starting Libft was both exciting and challenging. As a new student at 1337, this project pushed me to:
- Collaborate with peers during code reviews
- Think critically about implementation choices
- Build resilience through debugging sessions
- Develop a strong foundation in C programming

### 🤝 Peer Learning Experience

One of the most valuable aspects of working on Libft at 1337 was the peer learning environment. Through:
- Late-night debugging sessions with fellow students
- Sharing different approaches to the same problems
- Learning from others' mistakes and successes
- Building lasting friendships in the coding community

## 💭 Reflection

The Libft project was more than just a coding assignment - it was a foundational experience that shaped my programming journey. The challenges faced and overcome during this project have prepared me for more complex challenges ahead.
